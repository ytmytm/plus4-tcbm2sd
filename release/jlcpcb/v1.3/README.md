# SMD Manufacturing with JLCPCB

I was not able to correct the positioning issues in time. Make sure to use JLCPCB online positiong tool to adjust:

- U1 has to be rotated 90 deg left (to match dot on chip with dot on PCB)
- C5 has to be rotated 180 deg (to match + on capactitor with + on PCB)
- C6 has to be rotated 180 deg (to match + on capactitor with + on PCB)
- SD card connector (XS) has to be shifted left several steps, it's easiest to control looking on the bottom of PCB to check if two pegs appear exactly in the center of the PCB holes near the edge of the board
