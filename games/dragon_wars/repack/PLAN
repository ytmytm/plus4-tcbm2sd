1. combine all code into one binary:
    $0500	SUBS1 - binary + patches
		    patched loader ($37xx)
		    patched loader copier (not needed - $FF20 will be already there, unless exomizer would fail on that)
    $1800	start/restart (return from utils)
    $5600	initial loader - new code
    $5800	screen1 - from disassembly
    $5C00	screen2 - from disassembly
    $6000	bitmap  - from disassembly
    $8000	music   - binary
    $c000	intro loader - new code
    $ff20	game loader (partial) - new code

    New loader based on work done for Bard's Tale 3
	- booter can detect drive #8 or #9 and set the register offset
	- DoSectorOp+Read/Write -> ~$13e bytes - may not fit?

2. toolchain:
    - Kickass
    - Exomizer
	if fails on decompressing over I/O ($FD00-$FF1F)
	put gameloader into virtual and copy from intro loader

3. save to disk 1 with space occupied by former TITLEPIC/SUBS1/MUSIC freed
